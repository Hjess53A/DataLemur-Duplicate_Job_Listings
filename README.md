# DataLemur-Duplicate_Job_Listings
This was my first try on a practice question after I discovered DataLemur

The title was Duplicate Job Listings (Company: Linkedin, Difficulty: Easy)

Instructions:
Assume you are given the table below that shows job postings for all companies on the LinkedIn platform. Write a query to get the number of companies that have posted duplicate job listings (two jobs at the same company with the same title and description).
