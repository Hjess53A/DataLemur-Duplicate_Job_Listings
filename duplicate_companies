-- This was my initial query
--SELECT title, company_id, COUNT(*)
--FROM job_listings
--GROUP BY title, company_id
--HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

-- while it did give me an idea which company had duplicates and how many, 
-- the output being asked was just the number of companies

-- I initialy used CREATE TABLE but it cam back with: Only SELECT queries can be processed!
-- So instead I used With clause
-- note: I've also removed the title, and company_id 

with company_count as (SELECT COUNT(company_id)
FROM job_listings
GROUP BY company_id
HAVING COUNT(company_id) > 1)

SELECT Count(*)
from company_count
